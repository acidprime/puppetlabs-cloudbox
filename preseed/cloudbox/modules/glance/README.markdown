This module provides a set of manifests that can be used to install and
configure glance.

It is currently targettting the essex release of OpenStack.

## Platforms

* Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty)

## Quick Start

The below example shows how the classes from this module can be declared in
site.pp to install both the glance registry and api services on a node
identified as glance.

In the below example, the default port for the registy service has been
overridden from its default value of 9191.

    node glance {
      class { 'glance': }

      class { 'glance::registry':
        bind_port => '9393',
      }

      class { 'glance::api':
        registry_port = '9393',
      }
    }
