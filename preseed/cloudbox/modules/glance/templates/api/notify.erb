# ============ Notification System Options =====================

# Notifications can be sent when images are create, updated or deleted.
# There are three methods of sending notifications, logging (via the
# log_file directive), rabbit (via a rabbitmq queue), qpid (via a Qpid
# message queue), or noop (no notifications sent, the default)
